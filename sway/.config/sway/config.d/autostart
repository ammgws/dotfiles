# The below is needed for certain systemd services such as the one provided by mako to work.
# Mako itself will be autostarted by systemd whenever something wants to use notifications,
# however if I want to manually start a service that requires sway's environment vars then
# the systemctl commands must be run synchronously and not split into two exec statements, 
# since otherwise the service may be started before systemctl import-environment is complete.
# For example: exec "systemctl --user import-environment; systemctl --user start example.service"
exec systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY SWAYSOCK
exec hash dbus-update-activation-environment 2>/dev/null && \
     dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY SWAYSOCK
