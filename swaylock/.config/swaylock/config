# Over in swayidle, am using the -w (wait) option which blocks until the timeout
# command has finished executing. The goal is to ensure swaylock has finished
# locking the screen, so we need to use daemonize here otherwise swayidle
# will only continue after swaylock has exited via unlock, and any other timeout
# commands will not run until then
